# XTL - Xrm Templating Language [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/skqv53ykh62587qp?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/DigitalFlow/xrm-templating-language)

A domain specific language for Dynamics CRM allowing for easy text template processing

## Purpose
XTL is a domain specific language created for easing text processing inside Dynamics CRM.
It is an interpreted programming language, with easy syntax for allowing everyone to use it.

The parsing and interpreting is done using a custom recursive descent parser implemented in C#.
It is embedded inside a plugin and does not need any external references, so that execution works in CRM online and on-premises environments.

## Where to get it
Build it yourself by running `build.cmd`, or simply download from [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/DigitalFlow/xrm-templating-language/build/artifacts).

## How To Register
Register the assemblies using the Plugin Registration Tool.
You can then create steps in the pre operation stage. If you're on update message, be sure to register a preimg with all attributes needed for generating your texts.

You'll need an unsecure json configuration per step.

Properties in there:
- target: The target field for the generated text
- templateField: The source field for the template (for "per record" templates, for example if replacing place holders inside emails)
- template: A constant template that will be used for all records (for example when formatting addresses)

Target always has to be set, in addition to either template or templateField.

Sample (For formatting emails):
```JSON
{
    "target": "description",
    "templateField": "description"
}
```

## Benefits
When dealing with the default e-mail editor of Dynamics CRM, the borders of what's possible are reached fast.
XTL aims to integrate flawlessly into Dynamics CRM, to enhance the text processing capabilities. It is not limited to any specific CRM entity.
Using XTL provides the following benefits:

- Using of the primary entity's related entity values, no matter how "far" they are away (i.e. regardingobject.parentaccountid.ownerid.fullname for using the full name of the owner of the company that the contact receiving an email belongs to).
- Using of child entity values, where the primary record does not hold the lookup (i.e. all tasks associated to an account)
- Conditional Branching (If-Then-Else constructs)
- Generating Record URLs for all records reachable using above expressions
- Easy to learn syntax (I admit that there are currently quite a few brackets needed for complex expressions)

## General Information
- Make sure that your functions only return strings (i.e. string constants) or values generated by Text() at the top level. All other returns will be ignored.

## Types
Native Types:
- String Constants (Alpha numeric text inside quotes)
- Integers (Digit expression)
- Booleans (true or false)
- Functions (Identifiers without quotes followed by parenthesis with parameters)

In addition, null is also a reserved keyword.

## Functions
### If
Takes 3 Parameters: A condition to check, a true action and a false action.
If the condition resolves to true, the true action is executed, otherwise the false action.

Example:
```
If( IsNull ( Text("subject") ), "No subject passed", Text("subject") )
```

### Or
Takes 2 ... n parameters and checks if any of them resolves to true.
If yes, then true is returned, otherwise false

Example:
```
Or ( IsNull( Value ("parentaccountid") ), IsNull( Value ("parentcontactid") ) )  
```

### And
Takes 2 ... n parameters and checks if all of them resolve to true.
If yes, then true is returned, otherwise false

Example:
```
And ( IsNull( Value ("parentaccountid") ), IsNull( Value ("parentcontactid") ) )  
```

### Not
Takes a parameter that resolves to a boolean and reverts its value.

Example:
```
Not ( IsNull( Value ("parentaccountid") ) )  
```

### IsNull
Checks if a parameter is null. If yes, true is returned, otherwise false.

Example:
```
IsNull( Value ("parentaccountid") )  
```

### IsEqual
Checks if two parameters are equal. If yes, true is returned, otherwise false.
The parameters are required to be of the same type.
OptionSetValues are compared with their respective integer values.

Example:
```
IsEqual ( Value ( "gendercode" ), 1 )
```

### Value
Returns the object value of the given property.
You can jump to entities that are connected by a lookup by concatenating field names with a '.' as separator.

Example:
```
Value ("regardingobjectid.firstname")
```

### Text
Returns the textual representation of the given property.
You can jump to entities that are connected by a lookup by concatenating field names with a '.' as separator.

Lookups and OptionSetValues use their formatted values, all other properties are just stringified using .ToString.

Example:
```
Text ("regardingobjectid.firstname")
```

### RecordUrl
Returns the record urls of all entities or entity references that are passed as paramters.
For this to work, you have to set a secure json configuration with property organizationUrl set to your organization's url.
 
Example:
```
RecordUrl ( Value ( "regardingobjectid") )
```

### SubRecords
Returns a list of sub records to the passed records.
First parameter is a list of parent records, second the name of the sub entity, third the lookup on the sub entity and fourth the display name.
 
Example:
```
SubRecords ( Value ( "regardingobjectid"), "task", "regardingobjectid", "subject" )
```

### SubRecordTable
Returns a table of sub records with specified columns and record url if wanted.
First parameter is a list of parent records, second the name of the sub entity, third the lookup on the sub entity, fourth whether to include URL or not.
All subsequent parameters are treated as columns to retrieve.
 
Example:
```
SubRecordTable ( PrimaryRecord(), "task", "regardingobjectid", true, "subject", "description" )
```

### PrimaryRecord
Returns an entity reference to the current primary entity.
No parameters are needed.

Example:
```
PrimaryRecord ()
```

## Sample
Consider the following e-mail template content:
```
Hello ${Text("regardingobjectid.customerid.ownerid.firstname")},

a new case was associated with your account ${Text("regardingobjectid.customerid.name)}, you can open it using the following URL:
${RecordUrl(Value("regardingobjectid"))}
```

When creating an e-mail from above template or even just an outgoing e-mail with the template content as text it will resolve to:
```
Hello Frodo,

a new case was associated with your account TheShire Limited, you can open it using the following URL:
https://imagine-creative-url.local
```

I learnt writing the interpreter using the [Let's Build a Compiler Tutorial](https://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw/) by Jack Crenshaw.
Although being quite old, the technics are still the same and the advice is invaluable, it's a great resource for learning.
